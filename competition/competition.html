                <h3>LongHorn 2023</h3>
                After the huge success of LongHorn BBQ in 2022, we are so far in the planning of LongHorn BBQ 2023 that
                we
                are opening signup forms for 2023's barbecue competition with competitors and judges from all over
                Europe.
                <br> Once again the competition will take place in the second weekend of may (13th-14th of May).
                However, we
                are expecting a lot of the competing teams to show up friday the 12th and start to setup their team
                areas,
                or just to have fun. The competing teams are extremely enthusiastic and will always engange with the
                crowd
                to share their knowledge and passion for American BBQ.
            </div>
            <div class="dc-ambbq">
                As a new addition to LongHorn 2023, this will at
                the same time be the Danish Championship in American BBQ, so there are even more titles to bring home.
                The
                Danish Championship is not an open competition, but the best placed Danish team can show off the title
                as
                Danish Champions. This team will also win an invitation to <b>Jack Daniel's World Championship
                    Invitational
                    BBQ</b>, which is the World Championship in real American BBQ. The teams competing here are the best
                of
                the best from all around the world. So not only is this an amazing experience, but you also get the
                opportunity to get your BBQ team on the map, not only as Danish Champion, but also as a competitor in
                Jack
                Daniel's World Championship Invitational BBQ, probably one of the most fantastic experiences you can get
                as
                a team.
